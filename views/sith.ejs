                <p> â€• Darth Sidious</p>
                <br>
                <p>The <strong>Sith</strong>, also referred to as the <strong>Sith Order</strong>, was an
                    ancient religious order of Force-wielders devoted to the dark side
                    of the Force. Driven by their emotions, including hate, anger, and greed, the Sith were
                    deceptive and obsessed with
                    gaining power no matter the cost. The order reached the apex of its power under Darth
                    Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith
                    who achieved his order's goal of galactic conquest after a millennium of plotting. Within a
                    generation, however, the
                    deaths of Sidious and Darth Vader would mark the end of the order of Sith Lords.</p>
                <p>Thousands of years before the Clone Wars, the Jedi Order was fractured by a schism that began
                    when a rogue and his
                    followers turned away from the light side of the Force, believing the dark side was the path
                    to true power. Having
                    relocated to the planet Korriban in the Outer Rim Territories, their movement ultimately
                    evolved into the Sith Order.</p>
