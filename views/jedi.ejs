            <p>-- Yoda</p>
            <p>
                A <strong>Jedi</strong> was a devotee to the ways of the Jedi
                Order, an ancient order of protectors united by their ability to
                harness the power of the Force. Adhering to a doctrine that
                favored the light side of the Force, the Jedi aspired to attain
                a state of inner tranquility through calmness and meditation
                while avoiding emotions affiliated with the dark side of the
                Force, such as anger and hatred. Nevertheless, Jedi philosophy
                did not forbid a Jedi from acting in self-defense or in the
                defense of others. To that end, the weapon of a Jedi was the
                lightsaber, a blade composed of pure energy and different colors
                such as blue, green, purple, or yellow.

                Before the time of the Galactic Empire, a Jedi was a guardian of
                peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. The Jedi's
                commitment to peace and democracy brought them into conflict
                with an order of dark side wielders known as the Sith, who
                sought power and dominion over the galaxy. Emerging victorious
                from their wars with the ancient Sith, the Jedi carried on in
                their duty as peacekeepers for over a millennium until the
                advent of the Clone Wars twenty-two years before the Battle of
                Yavin. Faced with a pan-galactic civil war between the Republic
                and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Jedi adopted the
                mantle of generals and soldiers in the Grand Army of the
                Republic.
