            A <strong>Jedi</strong> was a devotee to the ways of the Jedi
            Order, an ancient order of protectors united by their ability to
            harness the power of the Force. Adhering to a doctrine that
            favored the light side of the Force, the Jedi aspired to attain a
            state of inner tranquility through calmness and meditation while
            avoiding emotions affiliated with the dark side of the Force, such
            as anger and hatred. Nevertheless, Jedi philosophy did not forbid
            a Jedi from acting in self-defense or in the defense of others. To
            that end, the weapon of a Jedi was the lightsaber, a blade
            composed of pure energy and different colors such as blue, green,
            purple, or yellow.

        <br />
        <p>
            The <strong>Sith</strong>, also referred to as the
            <strong>Sith Order</strong>, was an ancient religious order of
            Force-wielders devoted to the dark side of the Force. Driven by
            their emotions, including hate, anger, and greed, the Sith were
            deceptive and obsessed with gaining power no matter the cost. The
            order reached the apex of its power under Darth Sidious, the Dark
            Lord of the Sith who achieved his order's goal of galactic
            conquest after a millennium of plotting. Within a generation,
            however, the deaths of Sidious and Darth Vader would mark the end
            of the order of Sith Lords.

            A <strong>planet</strong>, often called a <strong>world</strong>,
            was a celestial body that was in orbit around a star, was neither
            a binary star nor a moon, and had cleared out the area around its
            orbit as it formed by causing all other smaller bodies in its
            orbit to accrete with it. As a consequence, it would not share its
            orbital region with any other bodies of significant size, except
            for moons or those collected later under its gravitational
            influence.

        <p>
            <strong>Speciesism</strong>, also known as
            <strong>xenocentrism</strong>, was a belief that one species was
            inherently superior to another or all other species. Similarly, it
            manifested itself in <strong>xenophobia</strong>, an overwhelming
            fear of and hate against other species, regardless of
            circumstance.
