                    I started coding by modifying the mIRC chat style back in the late 90's. I really liked what I found
                    and what I could do with a few simple lines of code. That was the beginning of my passion for code.

                    Time passed and I started my life as a gamer, I competed in many tournaments in Colombia and went
                    to countless LAN Parties. The code was being put aside little by little.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then it was time to chose a BAC. I started Electronic Engineering and I decided to
                    focus my professional career on something completely different than computing. I worked for 15 years
                    in
                    construction, in maintenance, in clinics but I always felt incomplete, nothing gave me a real
                    challenge or really passionate me.

                    Today, 23+ years after my first mIRC script modification, I started programming again ...
                    and I was never happier.

                Father of 2, husband of 1, fan of Star Wars and all related to it and future programmer, that's me.
